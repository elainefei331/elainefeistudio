            <p>In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it.

            <p>In the beginning was the Word. </p>
            <p>Western civilization rests upon those words.</p>
            <p>And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act. that nothing can precede action—no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act. </p>

            <p id="page5first">I believe the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to talk about its beginning. </p>

            <p id="page6-8">But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem acts marks its individual character. A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. to pretend, feign, impersonate.</p>

        <div class="page7">
            <p>Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page8">
            <p id="page8-1">And the lesson is always the same, and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, </p>
            <p id="hill">at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed.</p>
            <p id="page8-2">This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error. </p>
            <p id="page8-3">I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too <span id="loud">loudly</span>, they will get the wrong idea. </p>

Or, if you are blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="page10">
            <p id="semicolons">When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: </p>
            <p id="quote">“That’s a lot of semicolons!”</p>
            <p id="quote1">“That’s a lot of semicolons!”</p>

            <p id="quote4">“That’s a lot of semicolons!”</p>
            <p id="page10-1">he is absolutely right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page11">
            <p>You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, what connects the first line to the last, the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. Between the first and last lines there exists—a poem—and if it were not for the poem that intervenes, the first and last lines of a poem would not speak to each other.</p>
